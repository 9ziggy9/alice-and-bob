* Alice and Bob
Simple example of what a server is and does. Alice and Bob interfaces with native nodeJS net API to coerce binary blobs received at TCP ports into server instructions. Blobs are parsed then used to signal server procedures.
** How to use
Just run each server node with (for example):
#+BEGIN_SRC console
node alice.mjs
#+END_SRC
*** Interaction
I highly recommend you interface with servers via netcat--netcat has existed since 1995 and provides the simplest UI I know of to send raw binary to a port.
#+BEGIN_SRC console
sudo apt install netcat
#+END_SRC
To use netcat to open a socket run (say on Alice);
#+BEGIN_SRC console
nc localhost 8080
#+END_SRC
Once the socket is open, you can give instructions,
#+BEGIN_SRC console
ECHO hello world
#+END_SRC
